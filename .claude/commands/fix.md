# Bug Fix

Fix a bug or issue using the standard workflow.

## Process

### 1. Reproduce
- Understand the bug description
- Identify how to trigger the issue
- Note expected vs actual behavior

### 2. Investigate
- Search for related code
- Trace the code path
- Identify root cause

### 3. Fix
- Make minimal necessary changes
- Don't introduce new issues
- Handle edge cases

### 4. Verify
- Confirm the bug is fixed
- Check for regressions
- Consider adding a test

### 5. Report
- Explain what was wrong
- Describe the fix
- List files modified

## Quality Requirements

- Minimal changes (don't over-engineer)
- No placeholder code
- Test the fix thoroughly

## Important

- Don't guess at fixes - investigate first
- If uncertain, research before implementing
- Add a test to prevent regression
